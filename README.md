# IRC Bot for Nintendo Switch  

This is basic IRC bot for Nintendo Switch :)   

I know this is old school.  
I use to mess with IRC Bots and stuff alot hahahahah   
let see if I could get everyones switches in a IRC channel lol       
Just kidding!   
This is so basic :)      

the commands are  
!version  
!cfw - show you what cfw the switch is running.  
!hello   
!join #channel key   
!part #channel    
!privmsg nick/#chan message here   

The IRC bot now can reply to CTCP VERSION and TIME.    
   

you need to change irc server, channel, and key     
if you want it to join your own irc channel.
